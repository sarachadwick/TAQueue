If you would like to see the live version of this app, check out https://ta-queue.herokuapp.com/ !

This app allows Teacher's Assistants to sign in during their help hours, and students to sign into a waiting list. The TA's can then go through the queue signing students in and out.

In the future, I want to hook student help sessions up to SIS student IDs, so schools can track metrics on student usage and TA hours!
